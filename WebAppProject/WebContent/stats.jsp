			<h1>About the Team</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>Our team consists of three people, Michael Lapot who is our main html and css designer, he also enjoys helping around the team as he is also well versed in java. Our main server administrator Mohamed Ashour doesnâ€™t have much experience but is a quick learner and picked up quickly on MySQL and servlet handling. Last but definitely not least, Joseph Maclean. His leadership skills and great understanding of programming concepts pulls the team together. As our main java programmer he is also fairly knowledgeable on other aspects of web design, allowing him to help out around the team and put us in the right direction in times of confusion. We have all been working together since the start of the program which allows us to understand each others strong points and weak points. All these great aspects combined create Mi (Micheal Lapot) Mo (Mohamed Ashour) Jo (Joseph Maclean).</p>
