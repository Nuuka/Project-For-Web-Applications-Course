			<p>A Compiler (the term was coined by Grace Murrey Hopper in early 50s) is a program
that runs on some computer architecture under some operating system and transforms
(translates) an input program (source program) written in some programming language
into an output program (target program) expressed in different programming language.
Programming language compilers are part of a more general category of language
manipulation tools or programs â€“ Language Processors. Language processors include
natural language translators and interpreters, text editors, text-to-speech and speech to
text coverers, spell and grammar checkers and some others language tools.
Programming language interpreters are subset of programming language compilers. </p>
